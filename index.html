	<h1>Hi there, I'm LIU XIAO!</h1>
	<p>
	I'm a msc student at the Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.
	Recently, my main focus has been on Person Re-identification with deep neural networks, scalable machine learning
services, and Visual Kinship Recognition.		
		I am also open to trying new areas and ideas as well.

		Previously, I completed my BS in Automation at the Dalian University of Technology, 
		competed in several mathematics competitions and Mathematical Contest in Modeling and RoboCup Standard Platform League
		with some degree of success.
